# Game of life

## Introduction
Welcome to the game of life implementation in rust.


## For what
The goal of this repo is to have a simple project that implement the original game of life [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
With a simple approach and a simple [lib](https://github.com/ggez/ggez). 

It's a student software engineer project to learn Rust, and how to implement a graphic interface with it.

## Goal
Have a simple program to study and play with the rules of the original game. 
Understand it and create complex object.

The soft should manage high number of cells at the same time, show and not shown, to manage highly complex patterns.

## Run
```shell
cargo run -- ./map/base.map
```
