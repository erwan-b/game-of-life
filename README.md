# Game of life

## Introduction
Welcome to the game of life implementation in rust.


## For what
The goal of this repo is to have a simple project that implements the original game of life [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),[lifewiki](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).
With a simple approach and a simple [lib](https://github.com/ggez/ggez).
It's a student software engineer's project to learn Rust, and how to implement a graphic interface with it.

## Goal
Have a simple program to study and play with the rules of the original game. 
Understand it and create complex, object.
It should manage a high number of cells at the same time, show and not shown, to manage highly complex patterns.

Ps: This program takes the basic `.cells` file type from the wiki! You can easily test with their files. 
### If you find any bug, do not hesitate to open an issue!

## Run
```shell
cargo run -- ./map/base.cells
```
